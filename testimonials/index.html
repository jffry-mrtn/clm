                "If you are planning to organize events, CLM events is your go to event planner!  I can’t thank Caroline  enough for looking after the nitty gritty part of running the Proudly Pinoy 2017 event, making the program run so smoothly.  Caroline’s attention to details was commendable, her sticking to the schedule was great and her respectful and graceful manner of reminding people of their tasks was a welcome relief.  She took care of speeches, taking notes, making sure that speakers and presenters are ready, and reminded and prepped me for what I may have to say or do.  What more can I ask for? Having CLM events on my side allowed me to relax and enjoy the Proudly Pinoy event.   Thank you Caroline and CLM events for sharing your talent with TCDSB Proudly Pinoy.  You are such an asset to the community and I am so proud to have worked with you!"
